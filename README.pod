=head1 NAME

MooseX::Singleton - Turn your Moose class into a singleton

=head1 VERSION

version 0.30

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyApp;
    use MooseX::Singleton;

    has env => (
        is      => 'rw',
        isa     => 'HashRef[Str]',
        default => sub { \%ENV },
    );

    package main;

    delete MyApp->env->{PATH};
    my $instance = MyApp->instance;
    my $same = MyApp->instance;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A singleton is a class that has only one instance in an application.
C<MooseX::Singleton> lets you easily upgrade (or downgrade, as it were) your
L<Moose> class to a singleton.

All you should need to do to transform your class is to change C<use Moose> to
C<use MooseX::Singleton>. This module uses metaclass roles to do its magic, so
it should cooperate with most other C<MooseX> modules.

=head1 METHODS

A singleton class will have the following additional methods:

=head2 Singleton->instance

This returns the singleton instance for the given package. This method does
I<not> accept any arguments. If the instance does not yet exist, it is created
with its defaults values. This means that if your singleton requires
arguments, calling C<instance> will die if the object has not already been
initialized.

=head2 Singleton->initialize(%args)

This method can be called I<only once per class>. It explicitly initializes
the singleton object with the given arguments.

=head2 Singleton->_clear_instance

This clears the existing singleton instance for the class. Obviously, this is
meant for use only inside the class itself.

=head2 Singleton->new

This method currently works like a hybrid of C<initialize> and
C<instance>. However, calling C<new> directly will probably be deprecated in a
future release. Instead, call C<initialize> or C<instance> as appropriate.
